      top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more
      than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular
      lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John
      unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old â€” read all about his life and
      legacy here.
